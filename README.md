# A Use Case For the Prototype-Based Paradigm

Most programmers have taken classes on Object Oriented Programming.
Many are also aware of functional patterns, either from catching lisps,
riding OCamls, learning themselves a Haskell;
or maybe they've used functional features which have been becoming popular in mainstream languages.

Imperative, event-oriented, declarative... these were all paradigms featuring in
my AQA textbook back in school.
But one paradigm that I never heard of until I came across it in Bruce Tate's
book "Seven languages in seven weeks", was the so-called **"prototype-based paradigm"**.
The example language in the book was an esoteric language called Io, however the
book was quick to mention that the (most?) popular language Javascript also has
a prototype-based system for it's objects.

A natural question after learning this is: what's the point of **prototype-based** programming? Is it just *dynamic* object oriented pragramming? Is there anything that is more natural to express in a **prototype-based** way.
